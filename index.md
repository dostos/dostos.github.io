## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Human-Centered Computer Systems Lab](https://hcs.snu.ac.kr) under the supervision of professor [Youngki Lee](https://youngkilee.blogspot.com).
I build a [software platform](https://band.snu.ac.kr) for edge devices that enable real-time mixed reality applications for everyone. 

I have previous research experiences in medical image processing and deep learning during my masters. I was an enthusiastic game engine developer graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology and worked for [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net) at Microsoft Studios.
